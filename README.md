![Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/photo-affix/master/art/showcase.png)

This app is still in beta! You can [download the APK](https://github.com/afollestad/photo-affix/raw/master/apk/PhotoAffix.apk) 
to try it out. You can also [opt-in to beta testing on Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.afollestad.photoaffix). 

I commonly use [Screener](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.toastcode.screener) to make
device frame art, and I put the results side by side to make one showcase image for apps. PhotoAffix will help
you with that. Plus it's open source.
