# Photo Affix

![Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/photo-affix/master/art/demoshowcase.jpg)

This app is still in beta! You can [download the APK](https://github.com/afollestad/photo-affix/raw/master/apk/PhotoAffix.apk) 
to try it out. You can also [opt-in to beta testing on Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.afollestad.photoaffix). 

I commonly use [Screener](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.toastcode.screener) to make
device frame art, and I put the results side by side to make one showcase image for apps. PhotoAffix will help
you with that. Plus it's open source.

There are still a few important features to implement, such as downsizing results (since they can 
be very, very large right now depending on the size of input images). The [issue tracker](https://github.com/afollestad/photo-affix/issues) 
shows a list of features that are planned at the moment.
